Search Engine Query
You are given a list of search engine queries.

The queries are in the form of strings and do not contain any whitespace.

When you encounter the string “top <n>“, then output the top n search terms according to the popularity. Popularity is measured by the number of times a particular string appears in the list before the current occurrence of the word top. Note that those searches having the same popularity should be sorted lexicographically.

Input Format
The first line of input consists of an integer t. This is the number of test cases. 
For each test case, the first line of input contains c, where n is the combined number of search queries and top strings. Then c lines follow.

Output Format
For each test case, output contains m lines where m is the number of times top appeared in the list.

Each line of output contains at most n space separated strings ordered by popularity and ties broken lexicographically.

Constraints
1 <= < t <= 100 (This is the number of test cases)

2 <= < c <= 10000 (This is the number of search query strings + top strings)

1 <= n <= 1000 (Number appearing next to top)

1 <= s <= 6 (This is the size of search strings)
